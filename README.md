# Hi, Iâ€™m Agustin from Argentina :argentina:

I'm working at [Clave](https://clave.com) as a Devops/SRE
I'm passionate about learning new skills to help the automatization of all kinds of things in any type of enviroments (like business or IoT).

## Some skils
+ Kubernetes Production since 2018 in all its flavors... bare-metal, EKS, Openshift, minikube, k3s
+ AWS, Terraform, Docker, Ansible, Jenkins, Gitlab-CI
+ Use python and bash for scripting
+ Sometimes I write applications or API's on Golang that are usefule for my daily rutine 

My repos are kinda messy but I'm pretty sure you can find something that might be helpful to you.
